# Time Complexity Analyzer 📊

A Java Swing application that visualizes and analyzes the **time complexity** of common algorithms such as searching, sorting, and recursion (e.g., Fibonacci). This educational tool helps students and developers understand how algorithm performance varies with input size and data order.
